      <h2>User-Friendly</h2>
      <p>
        Built around a streamlined GNOME desktop, the system focuses on an easy,
        distraction-free interface without breaking your workflow. It ships with a
        complete office suite out of the box and includes pre-installed gaming tools,
        so productivity and play stay just a click away.

      <h2>Fully Customizable</h2>
      <p>
        Retains the full flexibility of Arch Linux—packages, kernels, and desktop tweaks
        remain completely under your control. You can tailor everything from the base
        system to the UI, keeping the classic Arch philosophy of “your system, your way”
        while adding our extra stability and gaming-friendly defaults.
